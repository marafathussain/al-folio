[[Harvard Catalyst Profile](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/201410){:target="_blank"}] [[HBI Connectome](https://brain.harvard.edu/hbi_connectome/mohammad-arafat-hussain/){:target="_blank"}] 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Image, Informatics & Intelligence (i3) Research Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/i3-lab){:target="_blank"} at Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. My research interests lie in machine/deep learning and its application to medical image analysis. 

Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Medical Image Analysis Lab (MIAL)](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/){:target="_blank"} at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html){:target="_blank"}, Burnaby, BC, Canada.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://bisicl.ece.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Vancouver. In my Ph.D. project, I primarily focused on kidney cancer detection and analysis in CT using deep learning. I also completed my M.A.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at UBC, Vancouver. My M.A.Sc. project focused on robust bone boundary localization in ultrasound to facilitate minimally invasive ultrasound-guided orthopedic surgery.

Before joining UBC, I completed M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/){:target="_blank"}. During my M.Sc., I worked as a Research Engineer and developed novel ultrasound elastography techniques for breast cancer detection. I also worked as a Software Engineer in the [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd){:target="_blank"} after completing my B.Sc. degree.
